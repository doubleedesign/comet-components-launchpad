# Comet Components Launchpad

This package contains foundational classes and global CSS from the [Comet Components library](https://www.cometcomponents.io). It is intended solely for use as the sole (in most cases) Composer dependency of the other standalone packages, to reduce duplication of code and assets in projects that use multiple standalone packages.
